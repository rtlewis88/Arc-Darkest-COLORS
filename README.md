<h1 align="center">Welcome to Nord-Black-Frost ðŸ‘‹</h1>
Nord-Black-Frost is a flat, dark-mode theme with transparent elements, for  GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments. Nord-Black-Frost also has two varieties of matching Icons and Folders.
</br>
</br>

The Nord developers describe the scheme as consisting of "an arctic, north-bluish color palette, created for the clean and uncluttered design pattern to achieve a optimal focus and readability for code syntax highlighting and UI components." In total, Nord is made up of sixteen, prudently crafted, "dimmed pastel colors for a eye-comfortable, but yet colorful ambiance." (nordtheme.com)

## âœ¨ Special Thanks:
- _Sven Greb_ and the _Nord team_ at: https://www.nordtheme.com/community#content, for initially advancing Nord, and for critical inspiration. 

***Matching Numix as well as matching Suru++ icons are also available for download here.

>Both the Suru++ and the Numix icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the Nord-Black-Frost desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

- _the Numix team_ for their inspiration, expertise and contributions at: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme.
-  The Suru-grounded icon set was initially designed and developed by _Sam Hewitt_ - under GPL3.
- The original Suru icon set and concept was created by _Matthieu James_ - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are _Andrea Bonanni_ (original author) and _Gustavo Costa_ .
-  Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by _Keefer Rourke_ - under GPL3/MIT. 
-  Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by _Twitter Team_ - under MIT. 
-  Some icons are based on Numix mime-types icons created by the _Numix Team_ - under GPL3.
